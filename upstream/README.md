# Upstream State (Autogenerated â€“ Do Not Edit)

This folder is used internally by the Thunderbird policy template generator script
to track the state of upstream policy templates from Mozilla.

## Purpose

The files in this directory serve as a snapshot of the last known upstream state.
They are used to:

- Detect and report upstream changes by comparing previous and current versions.
- Help automate GitHub issue creation when relevant changes are found.

## Important Notes

- **Do not edit, delete, or manually modify any files in this folder.**
- All contents are **automatically managed** by the generator script.
- Manual changes can interfere with the change detection logic and lead to
  incorrect results or missed updates.

## Summary

This folder exists purely for internal use by the script and has no functional
role beyond change tracking. It should be treated as read-only.
